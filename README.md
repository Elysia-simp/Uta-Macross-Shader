Any and all issues (although not favored) would be welcomed

Disclaimer: You'll most likely break your head over the render queue cause nothings consistant

Tested in 2018/2019/2020 LTS versions of Unity

I don't play VRChat so I can't garentee this'll work well on VRChat

The only things you need are Diffuse, Alpha Mask, And the Rimlight Sampler map

Alternatively AlphaMask can be edited into diffuse via Photoshop (or whatever you use) shader has togglable options for it
Mikumo Hair Shader is already mostly handled by the shader just edit the alpha slider to your liking
