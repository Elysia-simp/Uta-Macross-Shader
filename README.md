Any and all issues (although not favored) would be welcomed

Disclaimer: You'll most likely break your head over the render queue cause nothings consistant

Thanks to MrPolarbear for the help and suggestions

Tested in 2018/2019/2020 LTS versions of Unity

Should work in VRChat (Not quest compatible don't expect that any time soon)

___anything from here onwards is outdated!!___

The only things you need are Diffuse, Alpha Mask, And the Rimlight Sampler map

Alternatively AlphaMask can be edited into diffuse via Photoshop (or whatever you use) shader has togglable options for it

Mikumo Hair Shader is already mostly handled by the shader just edit the alpha slider to your liking

If you plan on recreating this effect on your own model or sumn

you'll need vertex colors for edgescale

Nothing special black = 0 and White = 1 go crazy

Valkyrie and stage shader explanations included in the future

Use those ones at your own discression
