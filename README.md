What originally was just a character shader but ended up being what I wrote for MrPolarBear


if you're only ripping characters then the Diva Folder is all you need

Otherwise use everything else at your discression 

# Diva Shader Short explanation

It works the same in uta and MGF (Uta just has alpha masks instead) plug sampler in sampler and diffuse into main texture and you'll be fine 

You might need to fix normals on your mgf models or wait to see if proper tangent support for the game gets added and see if it uses that (shader has a fail safe toggle)

Anything else is not finished or not too worthy of a explanation _Yet_
